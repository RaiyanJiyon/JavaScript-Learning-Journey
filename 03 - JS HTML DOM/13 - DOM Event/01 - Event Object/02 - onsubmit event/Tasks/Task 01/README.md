### **Task 1: Validate Email Address Before Form Submission**
Create a form with an email input field and a submit button. When the form is submitted, check if the email entered is in the correct format (e.g., contains "@" and a domain). If the email is invalid, prevent form submission and display an error message.

**Steps:**
1. Create an email input field.
2. Use the `onsubmit` event to validate the email format.
3. If the format is invalid, prevent the form from submitting and display a message.
