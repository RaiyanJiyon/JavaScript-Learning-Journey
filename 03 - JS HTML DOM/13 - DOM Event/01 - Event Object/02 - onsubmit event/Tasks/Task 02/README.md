### **Task 2: Prevent Empty Fields on Form Submission**
Create a form with two fields: "First Name" and "Last Name". When the user tries to submit the form, ensure both fields are filled. If either field is empty, prevent the form from being submitted and show a warning message.

**Steps:**
1. Create two input fields for first and last name.
2. Use the `onsubmit` event to check if both fields are filled.
3. If either field is empty, prevent form submission and show an error.
