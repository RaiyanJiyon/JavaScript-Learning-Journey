#### **Task 2: Volume Control Slider**
Create a video player with a slider that allows the user to adjust the volume. The slider should range from 0 (muted) to 1 (full volume). When the slider is changed, update the video's volume in real-time using the `volumechange` event.

**Steps**:
1. Use a `<video>` element with controls.
2. Add a range input (slider) to control the volume.
3. Use the `volumechange` event to update the video's volume when the slider is changed.
