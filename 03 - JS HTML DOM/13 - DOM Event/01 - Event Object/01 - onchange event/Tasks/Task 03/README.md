### **Task 3: Dynamic Price Calculation**
Create a form with a dropdown to select a product (e.g., "Phone", "Laptop", "Tablet") and an input field to enter the quantity. When the user changes either the product or quantity, dynamically calculate and display the total price below the form.

- **Hint**: Each product should have a different price, and you need to multiply the selected product's price by the quantity.

**Steps**:
1. Create a dropdown with product options.
2. Create an input field for quantity.
3. Use the `change` event to update the total price based on the selected product and quantity.
