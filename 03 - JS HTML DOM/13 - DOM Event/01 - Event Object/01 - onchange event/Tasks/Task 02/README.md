### **Task 2: Track Changes in Multiple Text Fields**
Create a form with two input fields (e.g., "First Name" and "Last Name"). When the user changes either field, update a paragraph below the form with the full name.

- **Hint**: Add two event listeners for the `change` event on both text fields and combine the values to display the full name.

**Steps**:
1. Create two input fields (`firstName` and `lastName`).
2. Add `change` event listeners to both inputs.
3. Display the concatenated full name below the form.
