### **Task 3: Toggle Event â€“ Expand/Collapse Section**
Create a "Read More" section on a webpage. Initially, only a small part of the text is visible, and the rest is hidden. When the user clicks a "Read More" button, the hidden text is revealed, and the button text changes to "Read Less" to allow collapsing.

**Steps:**
1. Create a section of text with part of it hidden initially.
2. Use a button to toggle between showing and hiding the rest of the text.
3. Use `textContent` to change the button text based on the toggle state.
