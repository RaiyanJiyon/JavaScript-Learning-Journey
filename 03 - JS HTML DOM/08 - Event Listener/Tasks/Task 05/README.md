### **Task 5: Multiple Event Listeners on One Element**
1. Create a button labeled "Event Listener".
2. Attach multiple event listeners to the button:
   - One that changes the button's text to "Clicked" when it's clicked.
   - One that logs "Mouse is over the button!" when the user hovers over it.
   - One that logs "Mouse has left the button!" when the user moves the mouse away.

**Requirements:**
- Use `addEventListener()` multiple times on the same element for different events.
