### **Task 3: Detect Arrow Key Presses**
1. Create a simple page with a `<div>` representing a character or block.
2. Detect when the user presses the arrow keys and move the block accordingly (up, down, left, right).

**Requirements:**
- Use the `keydown` event to detect arrow keys.
- Use CSS to move the block using `position` and `top`, `left` properties.
